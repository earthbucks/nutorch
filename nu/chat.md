i am using nushell. i want to make a very simple function that turns a list of
lists into a matrix.

suppose we have this data:

```nu
nu: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
╭───┬───────────╮
│ 0 │ ╭───┬───╮ │
│   │ │ 0 │ 1 │ │
│   │ │ 1 │ 2 │ │
│   │ │ 2 │ 3 │ │
│   │ ╰───┴───╯ │
│ 1 │ ╭───┬───╮ │
│   │ │ 0 │ 4 │ │
│   │ │ 1 │ 5 │ │
│   │ │ 2 │ 6 │ │
│   │ ╰───┴───╯ │
╰───┴───────────╯
```

we can display it as a matrix by adding column names:

```nu
nu: [["0", "1", "2"]; [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
╭───┬───┬───┬───╮
│ # │ 0 │ 1 │ 2 │
├───┼───┼───┼───┤
│ 0 │ 1 │ 2 │ 3 │
│ 1 │ 4 │ 5 │ 6 │
╰───┴───┴───┴───╯
```

this technically converts it from a list of lists to a table:

```nu
nu: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]] | describe
list<list<int>>
nu: [["0", "1", "2"]; [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]] | describe
table<0: int, 1: int, 2: int>
```

i'd like to make a nushell script that does this. how do we convert a a list of
lists into a table? note that in case the list of lists contains something other
than numbers inside, that's fine, we can just put whatever that is inside the
table.

# === ASSISTANT ===

Let's create a simple Nushell function to convert a list of lists into a
table/matrix format by adding column headers. Here's a solution:

```nu
def to-matrix [] {
    let data = $in  # Capture the input list of lists
    
    # Check if input is empty
    if ($data | is-empty) {
        return []
    }
    
    # Get the length of the first sublist to create column names
    let num_cols = ($data | first | length)
    
    # Create column headers as strings "0", "1", "2", etc.
    let headers = (0..($num_cols - 1) | each { |i| $i | into string })
    
    # Prepend headers to the data
    [$headers] ++ $data
}
```

Let's break down how this works and how to use it:

1. The function is named `to-matrix` and takes no explicit parameters. It uses
   `$in` to capture the input pipeline data.
2. It first checks if the input is empty to avoid errors.
3. It determines the number of columns by checking the length of the first
   sublist.
4. It creates headers as strings from "0" to "n-1" where n is the number of
   columns.
5. It combines the headers with the original data using the `++` operator to
   concatenate lists.

Here's how to use it with some examples:

```nu
# Example 1: Numbers
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]] | to-matrix
# Output:
# ╭───┬───┬───┬───╮
# │ # │ 0 │ 1 │ 2 │
# ├───┼───┼───┼───┤
# │ 0 │ 1 │ 2 │ 3 │
# │ 1 │ 4 │ 5 │ 6 │
# ╰───┴───┴───┴───╯

# Example 2: Mixed data types
[["a", "b", "c"], [1, true, "hello"]] | to-matrix
# Output:
# ╭───┬───┬──────┬──────╮
# │ # │ 0 │  1   │  2   │
# ├───┼───┼──────┼──────┤
# │ 0 │ a │  b   │  c   │
# │ 1 │ 1 │ true │ hello│
# ╰───┴───┴──────┴──────╯

# Example 3: Empty list
[] | to-matrix
# Output: (empty list)
```

Some additional notes:

- This function assumes that all sublists have the same length. If they don't,
  the display might look uneven, but it will still work.
- It works with any data type inside the sublists since Nushell tables can hold
  mixed types.
- If you want custom column names instead of "0", "1", "2", etc., you could
  modify the function to accept an optional parameter for column names.

If you want to add custom column names as an option, here's a modified version:

```nu
def to-matrix [--colnames: list<string>] {
    let data = $in
    
    if ($data | is-empty) {
        return []
    }
    
    let num_cols = ($data | first | length)
    
    let headers = if ($colnames | is-empty) {
        (0..($num_cols - 1) | each { |i| $i | into string })
    } else {
        $colnames
    }
    
    [$headers] ++ $data
}
```

Usage with custom column names:

```nu
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]] | to-matrix --colnames ["x", "y", "z"]
# Output:
# ╭───┬───┬───┬───╮
# │ # │ x │ y │ z │
# ├───┼───┼───┼───┤
# │ 0 │ 1 │ 2 │ 3 │
# │ 1 │ 4 │ 5 │ 6 │
# ╰───┴───┴───┴───╯
```

This should cover most use cases for converting a list of lists into a
table/matrix format in Nushell! Let me know if you have any questions or need
additional modifications.

how do i just produce a list of numbers as strings, `["0", "1", "2"]`? i need a
function that takes `n` and produces a list of strings from `0` to `n-1`.

# === ASSISTANT ===

In Nushell, you can create a list of numbers as strings from `0` to `n-1` using
a simple function. Here's how you can do it:

```nu
def range-str [n: int] {
    0..($n - 1) | each { |i| $i | into string }
}
```

Let's break down how this works:

1. The function `range-str` takes a single parameter `n` which is an integer.
2. `0..($n - 1)` creates a range from `0` to `n-1`.
3. `each { |i| $i | into string }` iterates over each number in the range and
   converts it to a string.

Here's how to use it with some examples:

```nu
# Example 1: n = 3
range-str 3
# Output: ["0", "1", "2"]

# Example 2: n = 5
range-str 5
# Output: ["0", "1", "2", "3", "4"]

# Example 3: n = 1
range-str 1
# Output: ["0"]

# Example 4: n = 0
range-str 0
# Output: []
```

This function will return a list of strings representing numbers from `0` to
`n-1`. If `n` is `0`, it returns an empty list. You can use this function as
part of your `to-matrix` function or anywhere else you need such a list.

If you want to integrate this directly into your previous `to-matrix` function,
you can replace the line that creates headers with this logic:

```nu
def to-matrix [] {
    let data = $in
    
    if ($data | is-empty) {
        return []
    }
    
    let num_cols = ($data | first | length)
    let headers = (range-str $num_cols)
    
    [$headers] ++ $data
}
```

This will achieve the same result as before, using the `range-str` logic inline.

if i have a matrix of size [3, 2], does that mean it has 3 rows and 2 columns?
this that the conventional order for [rows, columns] in mathematics libraries?

# === ASSISTANT ===

Yes, in the context of a matrix, a size of `[3, 2]` conventionally means **3 rows and 2 columns**. This is the standard notation used in mathematics and most programming libraries.

### Explanation:
- The first number in the pair `[3, 2]` represents the number of **rows** (the vertical dimension, i.e., how many sublists or records there are).
- The second number represents the number of **columns** (the horizontal dimension, i.e., how many elements are in each row or sublist).

So, a `[3, 2]` matrix would look like this in a visual representation (or in Nushell table format after converting a list of lists):

```
╭───┬───┬───╮
│ # │ 0 │ 1 │
├───┼───┼───┤
│ 0 │ a │ b │
│ 1 │ c │ d │
│ 2 │ e │ f │
╰───┴───┴───╯
```

Here:
- There are 3 rows (indexed as 0, 1, 2).
- There are 2 columns (indexed as 0, 1).

### Conventional Order in Mathematics and Libraries
Yes, the `[rows, columns]` order is the conventional notation in mathematics and most programming libraries:
- In **mathematics**, a matrix is typically described as having "m rows and n columns," often written as an "m × n matrix."
- In popular programming libraries like **NumPy** (Python), **MATLAB**, and others, the shape of a matrix or array is given as `(rows, columns)`. For example, `numpy.array.shape` returns a tuple where the first element is the number of rows and the second is the number of columns.
- In **linear algebra**, this convention is also standard when defining matrix dimensions.

### In the Context of Nushell
In your earlier examples with Nushell, if you have a list of lists like `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]`, this represents a matrix with:
- 3 rows (because there are 3 sublists).
- 2 columns (because each sublist has 2 elements).

After applying a function like `to-matrix`, it would display as a table with 3 rows and 2 columns (plus the row index column `#` that Nushell adds for display).

### Rare Exceptions
While `[rows, columns]` is the standard, there are rare cases in some specialized contexts or libraries where the order might be reversed (e.g., `[columns, rows]`), but this is not common and would typically be explicitly documented. Always check the documentation of the tool or library you're using if you're unsure.

In summary, `[3, 2]` means 3 rows and 2 columns, and this is the conventional order in mathematics and most computational contexts.
