i am using nushell. i want to make a very simple function that turns a list of
lists into a matrix.

suppose we have this data:

```nu
nu: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
╭───┬───────────╮
│ 0 │ ╭───┬───╮ │
│   │ │ 0 │ 1 │ │
│   │ │ 1 │ 2 │ │
│   │ │ 2 │ 3 │ │
│   │ ╰───┴───╯ │
│ 1 │ ╭───┬───╮ │
│   │ │ 0 │ 4 │ │
│   │ │ 1 │ 5 │ │
│   │ │ 2 │ 6 │ │
│   │ ╰───┴───╯ │
╰───┴───────────╯
```

we can display it as a matrix by adding column names:

```nu
nu: [["0", "1", "2"]; [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
╭───┬───┬───┬───╮
│ # │ 0 │ 1 │ 2 │
├───┼───┼───┼───┤
│ 0 │ 1 │ 2 │ 3 │
│ 1 │ 4 │ 5 │ 6 │
╰───┴───┴───┴───╯
```

this technically converts it from a list of lists to a table:

```nu
nu: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]] | describe
list<list<int>>
nu: [["0", "1", "2"]; [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]] | describe
table<0: int, 1: int, 2: int>
```

i'd like to make a nushell script that does this. how do we convert a a list of
lists into a table? note that in case the list of lists contains something other
than numbers inside, that's fine, we can just put whatever that is inside the
table.

# === ASSISTANT ===

Let's create a simple Nushell function to convert a list of lists into a
table/matrix format by adding column headers. Here's a solution:

```nu
def to-matrix [] {
    let data = $in  # Capture the input list of lists
    
    # Check if input is empty
    if ($data | is-empty) {
        return []
    }
    
    # Get the length of the first sublist to create column names
    let num_cols = ($data | first | length)
    
    # Create column headers as strings "0", "1", "2", etc.
    let headers = (0..($num_cols - 1) | each { |i| $i | into string })
    
    # Prepend headers to the data
    [$headers] ++ $data
}
```

Let's break down how this works and how to use it:

1. The function is named `to-matrix` and takes no explicit parameters. It uses
   `$in` to capture the input pipeline data.
2. It first checks if the input is empty to avoid errors.
3. It determines the number of columns by checking the length of the first
   sublist.
4. It creates headers as strings from "0" to "n-1" where n is the number of
   columns.
5. It combines the headers with the original data using the `++` operator to
   concatenate lists.

Here's how to use it with some examples:

```nu
# Example 1: Numbers
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]] | to-matrix
# Output:
# ╭───┬───┬───┬───╮
# │ # │ 0 │ 1 │ 2 │
# ├───┼───┼───┼───┤
# │ 0 │ 1 │ 2 │ 3 │
# │ 1 │ 4 │ 5 │ 6 │
# ╰───┴───┴───┴───╯

# Example 2: Mixed data types
[["a", "b", "c"], [1, true, "hello"]] | to-matrix
# Output:
# ╭───┬───┬──────┬──────╮
# │ # │ 0 │  1   │  2   │
# ├───┼───┼──────┼──────┤
# │ 0 │ a │  b   │  c   │
# │ 1 │ 1 │ true │ hello│
# ╰───┴───┴──────┴──────╯

# Example 3: Empty list
[] | to-matrix
# Output: (empty list)
```

Some additional notes:

- This function assumes that all sublists have the same length. If they don't,
  the display might look uneven, but it will still work.
- It works with any data type inside the sublists since Nushell tables can hold
  mixed types.
- If you want custom column names instead of "0", "1", "2", etc., you could
  modify the function to accept an optional parameter for column names.

If you want to add custom column names as an option, here's a modified version:

```nu
def to-matrix [--colnames: list<string>] {
    let data = $in
    
    if ($data | is-empty) {
        return []
    }
    
    let num_cols = ($data | first | length)
    
    let headers = if ($colnames | is-empty) {
        (0..($num_cols - 1) | each { |i| $i | into string })
    } else {
        $colnames
    }
    
    [$headers] ++ $data
}
```

Usage with custom column names:

```nu
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]] | to-matrix --colnames ["x", "y", "z"]
# Output:
# ╭───┬───┬───┬───╮
# │ # │ x │ y │ z │
# ├───┼───┼───┼───┤
# │ 0 │ 1 │ 2 │ 3 │
# │ 1 │ 4 │ 5 │ 6 │
# ╰───┴───┴───┴───╯
```

This should cover most use cases for converting a list of lists into a
table/matrix format in Nushell! Let me know if you have any questions or need
additional modifications.

how do i just produce a list of numbers as strings, `["0", "1", "2"]`? i need a
function that takes `n` and produces a list of strings from `0` to `n-1`.

# === ASSISTANT ===

In Nushell, you can create a list of numbers as strings from `0` to `n-1` using
a simple function. Here's how you can do it:

```nu
def range-str [n: int] {
    0..($n - 1) | each { |i| $i | into string }
}
```

Let's break down how this works:

1. The function `range-str` takes a single parameter `n` which is an integer.
2. `0..($n - 1)` creates a range from `0` to `n-1`.
3. `each { |i| $i | into string }` iterates over each number in the range and
   converts it to a string.

Here's how to use it with some examples:

```nu
# Example 1: n = 3
range-str 3
# Output: ["0", "1", "2"]

# Example 2: n = 5
range-str 5
# Output: ["0", "1", "2", "3", "4"]

# Example 3: n = 1
range-str 1
# Output: ["0"]

# Example 4: n = 0
range-str 0
# Output: []
```

This function will return a list of strings representing numbers from `0` to
`n-1`. If `n` is `0`, it returns an empty list. You can use this function as
part of your `to-matrix` function or anywhere else you need such a list.

If you want to integrate this directly into your previous `to-matrix` function,
you can replace the line that creates headers with this logic:

```nu
def to-matrix [] {
    let data = $in
    
    if ($data | is-empty) {
        return []
    }
    
    let num_cols = ($data | first | length)
    let headers = (range-str $num_cols)
    
    [$headers] ++ $data
}
```

This will achieve the same result as before, using the `range-str` logic inline.
Let me know if you have any other questions or need further modifications!

if i have a matrix of size [3, 2], does that mean it has 3 rows and 2 columns?
this that the conventional order for [rows, columns] in mathematics libraries?

# === ASSISTANT ===

Yes, in the context of a matrix, a size of `[3, 2]` conventionally means **3
rows and 2 columns**. This is the standard notation used in mathematics and most
programming libraries.

### Explanation:

- The first number in the pair `[3, 2]` represents the number of **rows** (the
  vertical dimension, i.e., how many sublists or records there are).
- The second number represents the number of **columns** (the horizontal
  dimension, i.e., how many elements are in each row or sublist).

So, a `[3, 2]` matrix would look like this in a visual representation (or in
Nushell table format after converting a list of lists):

```
╭───┬───┬───╮
│ # │ 0 │ 1 │
├───┼───┼───┤
│ 0 │ a │ b │
│ 1 │ c │ d │
│ 2 │ e │ f │
╰───┴───┴───╯
```

Here:

- There are 3 rows (indexed as 0, 1, 2).
- There are 2 columns (indexed as 0, 1).

### Conventional Order in Mathematics and Libraries

Yes, the `[rows, columns]` order is the conventional notation in mathematics and
most programming libraries:

- In **mathematics**, a matrix is typically described as having "m rows and n
  columns," often written as an "m × n matrix."
- In popular programming libraries like **NumPy** (Python), **MATLAB**, and
  others, the shape of a matrix or array is given as `(rows, columns)`. For
  example, `numpy.array.shape` returns a tuple where the first element is the
  number of rows and the second is the number of columns.
- In **linear algebra**, this convention is also standard when defining matrix
  dimensions.

### In the Context of Nushell

In your earlier examples with Nushell, if you have a list of lists like
`[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]`, this represents a matrix with:

- 3 rows (because there are 3 sublists).
- 2 columns (because each sublist has 2 elements).

After applying a function like `to-matrix`, it would display as a table with 3
rows and 2 columns (plus the row index column `#` that Nushell adds for
display).

### Rare Exceptions

While `[rows, columns]` is the standard, there are rare cases in some
specialized contexts or libraries where the order might be reversed (e.g.,
`[columns, rows]`), but this is not common and would typically be explicitly
documented. Always check the documentation of the tool or library you're using
if you're unsure.

In summary, `[3, 2]` means 3 rows and 2 columns, and this is the conventional
order in mathematics and most computational contexts.

this code works.

`table_from_list` essentially turns a list of lists intro a matrix for display
purposes.

however, both of my functions take arguments on the command line.

i want them to take input as stdin instead, presumably using the `$in` value of
nutorch.

how do i translate this code to use stdin instead of arguments?

```nu
def record_from_list [data: list] {
  mut my_record = {}
  for i in 0..( ($data | length) - 1) {
    let item = $data | get $i
    let name = $i | into string
    $my_record = $my_record | merge { $name: $item }
  }
  $my_record
}

def table_from_list [data: list<list>] {
  # initialize table to first row
  mut my_table = [[]; []]
  $my_table = record_from_list ($data | get 0)

  # then merge every row starting with the second row
  let num_rows = $data | length
  for i in 1..($num_rows - 1) {
    let row = $data | get $i
    let my_record = record_from_list $row
    $my_table = $my_table | append $my_record
  }
  $my_table
}
```

# === ASSISTANT ===

In Nushell, you can modify your functions to accept input from `stdin` (the
pipeline input) using the `$in` variable instead of taking arguments directly.
This is a common and powerful feature of Nushell, allowing functions to operate
on data passed through the pipeline.

I'll rewrite your functions `record_from_list` and `table_from_list` to use
`$in` instead of command-line arguments. When using `$in`, you don't need to
declare parameters explicitly unless you still want optional arguments or flags.

Here's the modified code:

```nu
def record_from_list [] {
    let data = $in  # Capture input from pipeline
    mut my_record = {}
    for i in 0..( ($data | length) - 1) {
        let item = $data | get $i
        let name = $i | into string
        $my_record = $my_record | merge { $name: $item }
    }
    $my_record
}

def table_from_list [] {
    let data = $in  # Capture input from pipeline
    
    # Check if input is empty
    if ($data | is-empty) {
        return []
    }
    
    # Initialize table to first row
    mut my_table = []
    $my_table = ($data | get 0 | record_from_list)

    # Then merge every row starting with the second row
    let num_rows = $data | length
    for i in 1..($num_rows - 1) {
        let row = $data | get $i
        let my_record = $row | record_from_list
        $my_table = $my_table | append $my_record
    }
    $my_table
}
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Removed Parameters**: Both functions no longer take explicit parameters
   like `[data: list]` or `[data: list<list>]`. Instead, they use `$in` to
   capture the input from the pipeline.
2. **Using `$in`**: The variable `$in` holds the data passed to the function via
   the pipeline. For `record_from_list`, `$in` will be a single list, and for
   `table_from_list`, `$in` will be a list of lists.
3. **Pipeline Usage**: You can now pipe data directly into these functions
   instead of passing arguments.
4. **Empty Check**: Added an empty check in `table_from_list` to handle cases
   where no data is provided via the pipeline.

### How to Use the Modified Functions

Here are some examples of how to use these functions with pipeline input:

```nu
# Example 1: Using record_from_list
[1, 2, 3] | record_from_list
# Output: {0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 3}

# Example 2: Using table_from_list
[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]] | table_from_list
# Output (as a table):
# ╭───┬───┬───╮
# │ # │ 0 │ 1 │
# ├───┼───┼───┤
# │ 0 │ 1 │ 2 │
# │ 1 │ 3 │ 4 │
# │ 2 │ 5 │ 6 │
# ╰───┴───┴───╯
```

### Key Notes

- **Pipeline Flow**: The pipeline input (`$in`) is automatically passed to the
  function when you use the `|` operator. For example,
  `[[1, 2], [3, 4]] | table_from_list` sends the list of lists to
  `table_from_list` as `$in`.
- **Chaining**: Since `record_from_list` now uses `$in`, it can be called in a
  pipeline within `table_from_list`, as shown in the modified code where
  `$row | record_from_list` passes each row to the function.
- **Error Handling**: If no input is provided (e.g., running `table_from_list`
  without piping data), `$in` will be empty, and the empty check will return an
  empty list. You can add more robust error handling if needed.

### Testing Edge Cases

You can test the functions with various inputs to ensure they work as expected:

```nu
# Empty input
[] | table_from_list
# Output: []

# Mixed data types
[["a", "b"], [1, 2]] | table_from_list
# Output:
# ╭───┬───┬───╮
# │ # │ 0 │ 1 │
# ├───┼───┼───┤
# │ 0 │ a │ b │
# │ 1 │ 1 │ 2 │
# ╰───┴───┴───╯
```

This should cover the transition from command-line arguments to pipeline input
using `$in`. Let me know if you have further questions or need additional
modifications!

thanks. these versions are working well. how do i create a description for each
of my new nu functions?

```nu
def "into row" [] {
    let data = $in  # Capture input from pipeline
    mut my_record = {}
    for i in 0..( ($data | length) - 1) {
        let item = $data | get $i
        let name = $i | into string
        $my_record = $my_record | merge { $name: $item }
    }
    $my_record
}

def "into matrix" [] {
    let data = $in  # Capture input from pipeline
    
    # Check if input is empty
    if ($data | is-empty) {
        return []
    }
    
    # Initialize table to first row
    mut my_table = []
    $my_table = ($data | get 0 | into row)

    # Then merge every row starting with the second row
    let num_rows = $data | length
    for i in 1..($num_rows - 1) {
        let row = $data | get $i
        let my_record = $row | into row
        $my_table = $my_table | append $my_record
    }
    $my_table
}
```

# === ASSISTANT ===

In Nushell, you can add descriptions to your custom functions using the `--help`
or `--description` metadata. This description will be visible when users run
`help <function-name>` or browse the command documentation. Adding descriptions
is a great way to document your functions for yourself and others.

You can include a description by adding a comment block or a string directly
above the function definition with the `#|` syntax, or by using a metadata
attribute. The preferred and most modern way in Nushell is to use the `#|`
comment block right before the function definition.

Here's how to add descriptions to your `into row` and `into matrix` functions:

```nu
#| Converts a list into a record with string keys "0", "1", "2", etc.
def "into row" [] {
    let data = $in  # Capture input from pipeline
    mut my_record = {}
    for i in 0..( ($data | length) - 1) {
        let item = $data | get $i
        let name = $i | into string
        $my_record = $my_record | merge { $name: $item }
    }
    $my_record
}

#| Converts a list of lists into a matrix (table) for display, where each inner list becomes a row with string column names "0", "1", "2", etc.
def "into matrix" [] {
    let data = $in  # Capture input from pipeline
    
    # Check if input is empty
    if ($data | is-empty) {
        return []
    }
    
    # Initialize table to first row
    mut my_table = []
    $my_table = ($data | get 0 | into row)

    # Then merge every row starting with the second row
    let num_rows = $data | length
    for i in 1..($num_rows - 1) {
        let row = $data | get $i
        let my_record = $row | into row
        $my_table = $my_table | append $my_record
    }
    $my_table
}
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Description Syntax**: The `#|` prefix followed by a description text is
   used to define the help text for the function. This is a concise way to
   document the purpose of the function.
2. **Viewing Help**: After defining the functions with descriptions, you can
   view the help text by running:
   ```nu
   help "into row"
   ```
   or
   ```nu
   help "into matrix"
   ```
   This will display the description along with other information about the
   command.

### Example Output of Help Command

Running `help "into row"` might display something like:

```
Converts a list into a record with string keys "0", "1", "2", etc.

Usage:
  > into row

Parameters:
  (none)

Examples:
  (none provided)
```

Similarly, `help "into matrix"` would show:

```
Converts a list of lists into a matrix (table) for display, where each inner list becomes a row with string column names "0", "1", "2", etc.

Usage:
  > into matrix

Parameters:
  (none)

Examples:
  (none provided)
```

### Adding More Detailed Help (Optional)

If you want to provide more detailed help, including examples or additional
notes, you can extend the description with multiple lines using the `#|` syntax.
For instance:

```nu
#| Converts a list into a record with string keys "0", "1", "2", etc.
#| This function takes a list from the pipeline and transforms it into a record
#| where each index becomes a string key mapping to the corresponding value.
#| Example: [1, 2, 3] becomes {0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 3}
def "into row" [] {
    let data = $in
    mut my_record = {}
    for i in 0..( ($data | length) - 1) {
        let item = $data | get $i
        let name = $i | into string
        $my_record = $my_record | merge { $name: $item }
    }
    $my_record
}
```

Unfortunately, as of the latest Nushell versions (up to my knowledge cutoff in
October 2023), the `help` command might not fully render multi-line descriptions
or examples in a structured way unless explicitly supported in newer updates.
However, the first line of the description will always be shown, and you can
check the latest Nushell documentation or release notes for improvements in help
rendering.

### Persistence of Descriptions

If you're defining these functions in a script or your Nushell configuration
file (e.g., `config.nu`), the descriptions will persist across sessions as long
as the script is sourced or the config is loaded. If you're defining them in an
interactive session, they'll only last for that session unless saved.

### Testing the Help

After adding the descriptions, test them by running the help commands:

```nu
help "into row"
help "into matrix"
```

This should display the descriptions you provided. If you're using a newer
version of Nushell, the help system might have additional features or formatting
options, so feel free to experiment or check the official documentation for
updates.

Let me know if you have further questions or need help with anything else!
