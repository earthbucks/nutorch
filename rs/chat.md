can you please summarize this chat so far, including:

- an overview of the nutorch project
- information about our use of rust
- information about our use of nushell
- information about our use of the tch-rs library
- information about our use of python
- code demonstrations

your summary shouldn't be too long, just detailed enough to provide all the most important points discussed so far.

Nutorch — project overview  
• Goal: a Nushell plugin that exposes PyTorch-style tensor functionality from Rust.  
• The compiled binary is named `nu_plugin_torch`; commands are invoked with the top-level word `torch` (e.g. `torch full`).  
• All tensors are stored in a global registry (UUID → `tch::Tensor`). Commands return the UUID string; other values (e.g. shapes) are returned as plain Nushell lists.

Rust side  
• Written as a single plugin crate; each CLI verb is a `Command*` struct implementing `PluginCommand`.  
• Shape/​type checks, broadcasting checks, etc. are done manually because LibTorch C++ errors are not caught by `tch-rs`.  
• Registry access is protected by a `Mutex<HashMap<String, Tensor>>`.  
• Helper utilities: `get_device_from_call`, `get_kind_from_call`, `add_grad_from_call`, and broadcasting validation.

Nushell usage patterns  
• Wherever reasonable we allow the *first* tensor to come through the pipeline and subsequent operands as arguments (e.g. `| torch add $b`, `| torch maximum $b`, `| torch squeeze 0`).  
• Some commands require list input for parity with PyTorch (`torch cat [$t1 $t2] --dim 1`).  
• Commands that only query metadata (e.g. `torch shape`) return a list and do **not** store the result in the registry.

tch-rs / LibTorch integration  
• `tch-rs` is the Rust binding to LibTorch; we rely on operators (`+  -  *  /`), `maximum`, `log_softmax`, `gather`, `unsqueeze`, `squeeze_dim`, `mm`, `cat`, etc.  
• Certain features (pin-memory, `.add_scaled`) were removed/​reworked to match available API.  
• We propagate `is_sparse()` as the `sparse_grad` flag when calling `gather`.

Implemented tensor commands (highlights)  
• Creation: `torch tensor`, `torch full [size] value`, `torch linspace`, `torch randn`, `torch repeat`, `torch manual_seed`.  
• Unary ops: `log_softmax`, `mean`, `neg`, `squeeze`, `unsqueeze`, `shape`.  
• Binary/​element-wise ops with broadcasting: `add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`, `maximum`.  
• Matrix/​concat ops: `mm`, `cat`.  
• Indexing: `gather` (pipeline-source, `(dim index)` arguments).  
• Each command validates dimensions, broadcasting, dtype, etc., and returns a new tensor UUID.

Python reference  
• We continuously compare behavior to PyTorch examples (e.g. `torch.full`, `torch.max`, `torch.log_softmax`, operator overloading like `-tensor`).  
• A helper Nu function `cross_entropy_loss` was written, mirroring Python logic (`log_softmax → gather → mean → neg`).

Code demonstrations & tests  
• One-liner Nushell tests accompany every new command (e.g. broadcasting failure case for `maximum`; shape checks for `gather`; pipeline vs argument examples).  
• Small Nu test scripts have been created to automatically assert expected output or expected errors using helper functions like `compare_nested_lists`.

Key design decisions  
1. Always store only `Tensor`s in the registry; non-tensor metadata is returned directly.  
2. Follow PyTorch argument order when possible (`torch full [size] value`).  
3. Prefer pipeline-first style for unary/​binary ops; allow list-or-arg fall-backs where unambiguous.  
4. Manual broadcasting and shape checks to pre-empt LibTorch runtime panics.
