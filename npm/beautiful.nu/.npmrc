hoist=false
install-strategy=nested

# Including both `hoist=false` and `install-strategy=nested` in the `.npmrc`
# file of every Nushell npm package is a best practice to maximize the
# reliability of Nushell script dependencies, especially for nested
# dependencies, when installed via npm or pnpm. Nushell scripts often rely on
# sourcing other scripts using relative paths like `source
# ./node_modules/<dependency>/scripts/<script>.nu`, which requires each package
# to have a local `node_modules` folder containing its dependencies. npm’s
# default hoisting can break these paths by moving dependencies to the
# top-level `node_modules`, while pnpm’s default behavior ensures local
# `node_modules` folders with symlinks but can still hoist unless explicitly
# disabled. By setting `install-strategy=nested` for npm, you ensure a fully
# nested `node_modules` structure with physical copies, guaranteeing local
# paths work. For pnpm, `hoist=false` enforces a strict nested structure with
# symlinks, maintaining compatibility. Including both settings in `.npmrc`
# ensures that, regardless of whether users install with npm or pnpm, all
# dependencies of dependencies have local `node_modules` folders, making
# `source` commands reliable and preventing failures due to missing paths.
